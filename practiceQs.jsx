// 1.  Destrucuture the results of the use State hook and pass in the important part to the component so it displayes the word "yes"

//2. Create an event listener that changes the state from "yes" to "no" when clicked

//3. Create an event listener using state that increase a counter by onne when a button is clicked

//4. While 2 and 3 work, they are not best practice when changing the value of state; using an anonymous  callback function is best practice to change the state
//value. Do number 3 but using best practices.
